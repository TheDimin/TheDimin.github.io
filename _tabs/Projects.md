This was a year long school project,
Where we got to build our own engine from scratch. I was involved with the engine architecture sine the start. 
And have been involved with most engine systems & architecture.

The game is released for the public on itch.io. But internally we have the game also running on ps5.

(I am working on getting it to run on the switch.)
