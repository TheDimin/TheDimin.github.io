<!---# Sbox Splatoon (2023)

This project was build in a few weeks, It was me building a gamemode on a new game creation platform by the makers of Garry's mod. 
I did this to see what is possible with their tools & and learn how they structure workflow.
They have a big focus on quick iteration time, I love how fast i can iterate on UI!

This was a year-long school project.
We got the opportunity to create a game engine.

I have been responsible for the engine architecture since the start of the project.
and such I have worked on most engine systems to some degree.

The game has been made for PC and PS5.
And I am actively working on porting the game to the switch!

the video shown is of an old project that got me hooked on game development.<br><br>
I love the idea of games such as fiveM and Arma roleplay.
This was an attempt of me creating something like that.<br><br>
It never got or will be finished, but it shows one of the projects that got me started with game development.
