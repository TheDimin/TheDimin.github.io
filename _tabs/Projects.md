# Project Ball (2024)

To be announced......

<!---# Sbox Splatoon (2023)

This project was build in a few weeks, It was me building a gamemode on a new game creation platform by the makers of Garry's mod. 
I did this to see what is possible with their tools & and learn how they structure workflow.
They have a big focus on quick iteration time, I love how fast i can iterate on UI!

This was a year long school project,
Where we got to build our own engine from scratch. I was involved with the engine architecture sine the start. 
And have been involved with most engine systems & architecture.

The game is released for the public on itch.io. But internally we have the game also running on ps5.

(I am working on getting it to run on the switch.)

During the global game jam I had the oppertunity to work with some cool people again, this time in Amsterdam.
I worked on the audio using fmod, The player & camera (Early itteration), and the code behind the UI for the dialog system.
This project required me to closely colleberate with other people on the team to build the vision they had as i was mostly focused on providing the tools.

I went alone to utrecht for the global game jam and ended up with a team of professionals!
With this team we made the game shown on the left.
I was responsible for The Dialog system, UI and audio.

This is a old project that really got me hooked on gamedevelopment.
I really like the idea of a games like fiveM,Arma roleplay.
This was a attempt of me making something like that.
It never got or will be finished, but it shows one of the projects i started with.
(I worked on this alone)
