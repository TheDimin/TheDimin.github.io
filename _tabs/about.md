My name is Damian van Hoorn, I am a student at Buas studying game development.
With a particular interest in building custom engines.

I started out working with engines like unity and unreal and Learned a great deal from this, But my passion lies with creating custom tech.
My education has given me to chance to build a two custom engines from the ground up, one in year 2 (Which delivered Hellbound) and one in year 3 (To be announced). 

This has allowed me to learn a great deal about cross platform development and creating tools based on the teams needs.
From input, cross platform api's & workflows, Intergrating runtime reflections for UI and lua bindings. 
And Being a important factor in creating the architecture and solving technical problems.
