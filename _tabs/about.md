## About Me
My name is Damian van Hoorn, 24 years old, currently studying game development at Buas.<br>
I interested in building custom engines and tools!

<br><br>
My journey with game development started with making games in Unity and Unreal, As a student I have made many (~15+) Games. From game jams, and 3-week-long school projects,
Custom engines I worked on for a year, and a Multiplayer shooter in Unreal as the only programmer on the team.<br>
These experiences not only taught me about programming and game development. It provided me with the experience of working with many different APIs.<br> It has shown me how valuable it is to take Design into account so that you have a good time developing what you care about, **The games!**<br>

I have always been a huge fan of RTS and open-world multiplayer games. There was a time when I wanted to create those types of experiences. But over time my interest has shifted from gameplay to game technology. What tech can I create to empower those multiplayer open-world games?
That's what I hope to focus on and learn about in the coming years.

My interest in custom engines came from my time at BUAS here I worked on two amazing projects with custom engines: one in my second year, **Hellbound**, and another that is currently in development.<br>
These projects have deepened my understanding of cross-platform development and tool creation tailored to team requirements.  
<br><br>My contributions have ranged from `cross-platform engine design`, `DearImgui and lua (c-API) bindings through reflection` to `GitHub actions for CI/CD`<br>
My role has been pivotal in architecting solutions and resolving technical challenges as they arise.?.
