## About Me
I am Damian van Hoorn, currently studying game development at Buas.<br>
I focus on building custom engines!
<br><br>
My journey in game development began with making games in Unity and Unreal as a student over time have made as many (~15+) Games. From game jams, and 3-week long school projects, to a full block Building a Multiplayer shooter in Unreal as the only programmer on the team.<br>
These experiences not only taught me about programming and game development but also provided me with experience with many different API's for writing gameplay.<br> It shows me how valuable it is to take this into account so that you have a good time developing what you care about, **Those games!**<br>

A great deal of my experience as a gamer comes from open-world multiplayer games. There was a time when I wanted to create those types of experiences. But over time my interest has shifted from gameplay to game technology.<br> It came from my University projects, including the development of two custom engines: one in my second year, **Hellbound**, and another that is currently in development.<br>
These projects have deepened my understanding of cross-platform development and tool creation tailored to team requirements. 
<br><br>My contributions have ranged from `cross-platform engine structure design` to `DearImgui and lua c-API bindings through reflection` or `GitHub actions for CI/CD`<br>
My role has been pivotal in architecting solutions and resolving technical challenges as they arise.
