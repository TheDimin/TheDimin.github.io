## About Me
I'm Damian van Hoorn, currently studying game development at Buas, with a specialized focus on custom engine development.

My journey in game development began with making games in Unity and Unreal as a student a build many (15+) Games. From game-jams, 3 week long school projects, to a full block Building a Multiplayer shooter in unreal as the only programmer on the team. 
These experiences not only learned my about programming and gamedevelopment but also provided  me valuable insights into API design, and how its valuable to take your team upfront so that later it doesn't cause trouble. This has led to me giving a great detail to carefully crafting a system API's so that they are easy to use and extenadable if the requirments deem so.

A great deal of my experience as a gamer has been from open-world multiplayer games. I always wanted to build my own type of experiences for this.
But over time my interest has shifted from gameplay to game techonlegy. It was fueled by my University projects, including the development of two custom engines: 
one in my second year, [Hellbound](https://thedimin.github.io/posts/HellBound-Overview/), and another that is currently in development. 

These projects have deepened my understanding of cross-platform development and tool creation tailored to team requirements. My contributions have ranged from input systems and logging to integrating GitHub actions for builds and unit tests, as well as cross-platform APIs, runtime reflections for DearImgui, and Lua bindings. 

My role has been pivotal in architecting solutions and resolving technical challenges as they arise.
